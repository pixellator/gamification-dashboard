VSCode-X-prompt.txt

1. Please read the Gamification-and-Inference-Workflow.pdf document
(call it "GIW") and create a software specification file
Dashboard-plan.md containing a detailed description of a new VSCode
extension to support this workflow.  The following are features that
this dashboard should offer.

2. Features of the dashboard:

a. It's a new panel for VSCode that will provide interactive
control of the processes described in GIW.

b. The panel should have a File menu that allows creating new
gamification projects, and opening, editing, and saving existing
ones.  The projects themselves will be represented as text files
in a special format that makes them human-readable and readable
by methods of the dashboard and associated software tools.

c. The panel should contain drop-down menus for selecting source
documents, prompting documents, game-specification documents,
game-trace documents, and evaluation tools.

d. When any file is selected by the user in one of these drop
down menus, there should be a small button that when clicked
opens the file in a VSCode editor for viewing and editing.
