VSCode-X-prompt.txt

1. Please read the Gamification-and-Inference-Workflow.pdf document
(call it "GIW") and create a software specification file
Dashboard-plan.md containing a detailed description of a new VSCode
extension to support this workflow.  The following are features that
this dashboard should offer.

2. Features of the dashboard:

a. It's a new panel for VSCode that will provide interactive
control of the processes described in GIW.
The panel layout should reflect the left-to-right ordering
of the phases shown in the figure in GIW.

b. The panel should have a File menu that allows creating new
gamification projects, and opening, editing, and saving existing
ones.  The projects themselves will be represented as text files
in a special format that makes them human-readable and readable
by methods of the dashboard and associated software tools.

c. The panel should contain drop-down menus for selecting source
documents, prompting documents, game-specification documents,
game-trace documents, and evaluation tools.

d. When any file is selected by the user in one of these drop
down menus, there should be a small button that when clicked
opens the file in a VSCode editor for viewing and editing.

e. When a project is opened from the file menu, its key
attributes (defined in GIW) should be used to populate as many
of the drop-downs and labels in the panel as are specified
in the project file being opened.  Any unspecified items can
be left blank or "?" in the panel.

f. At the play-testing and technical analysis stage of the
workflow the dashboard should provide a button to launch the
game in the Text SOLUZION client and another button to
launch the game in the Web SOLUZION client.

g. There should be hooks or clear comments in the code that
implements the panel to show where new functionality can be
added: for example, new buttons might be added in future
versions of the panel, an where to put the code to handle
clicks on these buttons should be clear to future developers.

h. The panel should have a stylish light-blue background,
and all text on the panel should be in at least a 16-point
black font.  There should be a title at the top of the
panel in medium-sized violet lettering: "New Inferences from Gamification
Project" and under it in larger, dark-gray lettering: "Gamification and
Inference Workflow Dashboard".

i. It should be possible to have the panel work in either
sidebar mode (like many VSCode extensions) or full-screen
mode. In sidebar mode, there should be scroll bars to give
the user access to the entire panel.
